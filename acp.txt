Directed acyclic Graph
Topological ordering: it is an ordering in acyclic if a node is connected node b, the node a apprears before b.
BFS travarsal

Numbe paths between nodes:
Path(x) : is the number of paths from starting node a to z.
the number of paths form starting node a to node b:
path(b)=path(s1)+path(s2)+path(s3)
for the starting node:

path(a)=1

successer graph: for a directed graph with outdegree of every nodes is !
succ(x)
succ(x,k)

succ(x.k)=succ(x) k==1
         =succ(succ(x,k/2),k/2)  k>1

         k=2^m

a=succ(X)
b=succ(succ(X))
while(a!=b){
    a=succ(a)
    b=succ(succ(b))
}

a=x
b=x

while(a!=b){
    a=succ(a)

}
